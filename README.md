## Features:
* The **TypeCast** app allows you to literally create a program digest in one touch.

* Three sections are available:
  1. Android - Programs.
  2. Android - Games
  3. Programs for Wearable Devices.

* By default, when you open it for the first time, the "Android - Programs" section is selected, but the program remembers which section was selected before it was closed, and will open it the next time you open it.

* Each time you open the application, the date period for the current week is selected.

* The header of the application displays the selected section and period.
* Clicking on the header moves the digest to the beginning.

* Digest text formatting is adaptive for each forum section.

* The links in the digest text are clickable. You can go directly to the desired topic.

* The "Send" button copies the digest to the clipboard and opens the appropriate topic for publishing the digest. All you have to do is paste text and publish the post.

* Both light and dark themes are supported.
* The dark theme is AMOLED.

* The color scheme of the program changes depending on the selected section.

* The app is available for different platforms:
  1. Android 4.1 and above
  2. Windows 10 and above
